#Binary Search Threes


##Concept

The binary search three is a binary three that follows 3 rules.

1.The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
2.The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
3.The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.


## Manipulation

Functions needed to understand and manipulate binary search trees:

* initialize the tree
* insert an element
* fetch an element
* count the number of elements
* read the tree
* remove an element
